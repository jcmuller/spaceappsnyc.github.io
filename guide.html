        <h3 name="#welcome">Welcome Message</h3>

        <p>Welcome to the NASA International Space Apps Challenge!! We’ve noticed that many of you are new registrants this year, so we’re providing this guide to help you prepare for one of the most awesome space science events the city of New York has ever seen.</p>

        <p>Space Apps NYC is no ordinary hackathon! First and foremost, please read our Code of Conduct to familiarize yourself with all of our policies - when you’re at the registration table on site, we are going to ask you to sign a copy of it to acknowledge that you’ve read it, so look it over now.</p>

        <p>You must hack on a project for the majority of the weekend. You should probably expect to spend around a minimum of 11 full hours over the course of the weekend working on a project. Everyone can contribute something, even if it’s just working on the final presentation and demo! Although the hackathon will take place on the 5th floor, you will have full access to the conference and festival on the 6th floor, and there will be opportunities for you to enjoy parts of the festival when it is closed off to the public at the beginning and end of the day on Saturday.</p>

        <p>We’re not going to prevent anyone from going to the festival to see a particular speaker during the day, but if we notice or hear reports that hackathon participants aren’t contributing enough to their team, we’ll have to ask them to leave the hackathon and remain on the festival floor.</p>

        <p>We still have very high interest from many people who want to participate in this hackathon, and we’d like to give everyone who’s up for it a chance to do something amazing for the common good; if you would rather just enjoy the festival, it’s totally okay to unregister for the hackathon and open up the spot for someone else - there are plenty of festival tickets still available!</p>

        <h3 name="#arrival">Arrive Early Saturday Morning For Entry; Only 200 May Enter - First Come, First Served</h3>

        <p>On Saturday April 11th, You must arrive at 11 Times Square before 8:15 a.m. Yes, that is a very early time on a Saturday morning, but the early bird gets the space worm!</p>

        <p>We only have capacity for 200 people at the hackathon, even though 400 of you have registered to attend. We will be counting everyone as they enter, and when we reach capacity, any hackathon registrant in line who does not get in will get a ticket voucher for priority entry into the festival and conference that opens to the public at 11:45 a.m. Again, if you registered for both the hackathon and the festival, please unregister for the festival on Eventbrite! Festival entry is also first come, first serve, so arriving early will definitely get you into the festival if you don’t get in to the hackathon.</p>

        <p>If you would like to be guaranteed entry, we are looking for volunteers to help us at both the hackathon and the public festival - volunteers will need to commit to a certain number of hours / shifts in order to qualify for entry into the event. For more info, contact us immediately at spaceappsnyc@gmail.com!</p>

        <p>If you are coming from out of town for the event we highly recommend arriving at 11 Times Square as early as possible to best insure your entry into the hackathon. There are a limited number of hotel rooms* available at a discounted price at our partner hotel Yotel, located just two blocks West of the Space Apps NYC location:</p>

        <p>Premium Queen Cabin (sleeps 2) for $199 per night<br />
        Premium Queen w Overhead Bunk (sleeps 3) for $219 per night<br />
        Premium Queen w Double Bunk (sleeps 4**) for $299 per night<br /></p>

        <p>*ROOMS ARE NON-REFUNDABLE. No matter what it says on Yotel’s website.<br />
        **The double bunk is a bit on the small side, and would be better for smaller folks.</p>

        <p>If you are interested in getting a Yotel room, send us an email at spaceappsnyc@gmail.com and we will give you all the information you need to book a room at the discounted price.</p>

        <h3 name="#childcare">Send Us Information About Your Childcare Needs</h3>

        <p>We really need your help! We are committed to providing childcare for all three days of the bootcamp and the hackathon, but you must tell us what your needs will be so that we can get enough service from the providers who will be caring for children on site. Please send us email at spaceappsnyc@gmail.com to tell us what to expect!</p>

        <h3 name="#bootcamp">More On Friday’s NASA Space Apps Data Bootcamp</h3>

        <p>On Friday, April 10th, NASA is holding its first Space Apps Data Bootcamp - an opportunity for individuals who have never participated in hackathons to get their feet wet learning skills and using resources that will help them to engage productively as project team members, as well as to gain a better understanding of how their existing skills and perspectives can be an asset to their project teams.</p>

        <p>NASA is pioneering ways to diversify the base of hackathon participants to include communities with an ever-greater variety of backgrounds and skills and increase participation from underrepresented groups. In keeping with NASA’s focus on Women in Data for the 2015 International Space Apps Challenge, the Space Apps Data Bootcamp will be led by many exceptional women making an impact on the world through their engagement with data.</p>

        <p>The bootcamp is a free public event and space is very limited. For participants who have young children, childcare will also be provided on site at the bootcamp. If you think you would be a good fit for the NASA Women in Data bootcamp, please tell us why you’d like to attend in email to spaceappsnyc@gmail.com and we will forward your name on to the NASA organizers of the bootcamp.</p>

        <h3 name="#prepare">Make Some Pre-hackathon Preparations</h3>

        <p>Should you bring a laptop? Absolutely, yes! Everyone should bring a computer with them that they feel comfortable using. Even if you don’t have any special software on it, bring it anyway; your team members and other mentors from top technology companies and educational institutions will be there to help you get set up with whatever you need, and teach you about some great tools to help you solve problems.</p>

        <p>Here are some other tasks we recommend you all do today, right now, regardless of your skills or background:</p>

        <p>Join our Meetup group - http://www.meetup.com/Space-Apps-NYC/</p>

        <p>Get a Twitter account and Follow @SpaceAppsNYC on Twitter - https://twitter.com/</p>

        <p>Get a Github account (everybody needs one!) - https://github.com/</p>

        <p>Try git - https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1</p>

        <p>http://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1</p>

        <p>Once you’re comfortable with git and Github, if you have an Apple laptop, you can “git clone” the scripts at the link below which will load up your computer with all the software you would need to do web development; even if you aren’t a developer and don’t want to become one, you’ll be able to learn some really cool tips and tricks that will help you get more out of your computer, and doing this will generally make your computer more awesome:</p>

        <p>https://github.com/18F/laptop</p>

        <p>If you’re already a developer (front end or back end) and have development software installed, update all of your development software now. Save yourself a lot of wasted time and all the overhead of installing and updating a ton of stuff while you’re trying to hack.</p>

        <h3 name="#challenges">Check Out The 2015 Challenges, Now Online</h3>

        <p>Take a look at the 35 Challenges and see which you might be interested in working on:</p>

        <p><a href="https://2015.spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/" target="_blank">https://2015.spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/</a></p>

        <p>Don’t feel intimidated! You will be part of a great team with a diverse set of skills and you will all tackle these problems together. Notice that each Challenge has hashtags, where a # precedes a word or phrase (like #EarthView or #BuildTheFuture). When you write a tweet on Twitter and use one of those hashtags, other people all over the world will know you’re working on the same Challenge and you can collaborate and share ideas to make solutions together or independently. We also recommend the use of online video chat apps like Skype or Google Hangout to connect with people all over the world to get their help solving problems!</p>
