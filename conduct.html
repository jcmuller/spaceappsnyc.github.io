	<p><strong>This policy has been adapted from the StartupBus Code of
	  Conduct written by Elias Bizannes and Mitch Neff, which was
	  in turn adopted from the Ada Initiative&#8217;s guide
	  titled <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Responding_to_reports"
	  target="_blank">"Conference anti-harassment/Responding to
	  Reports"</a>.</strong>y</p>

	<p>Space Apps NYC is dedicated to providing a
	  harassment-free experience for everyone regardless of
	  gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation,
	  disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or
	  religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in
	  any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for
	  any event venue, including talks or pitches. Participants
	  violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the
	  event at the discretion of the organizers.</p>

	<p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments
	  related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual
	  orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size,
	  race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate
	  intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or
	  recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events,
	  inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual
	  attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior
	  are expected to comply immediately.</p>

	<p>Sponsors and partners are also subject to the
	  anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors and partners
	  should not use sexualized images in activities or in any
	  other material. Representatives of our sponsors and partners
	  should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or
	  otherwise create a sexualized environment.</p>

	<p>Remember that exclusionary jokes can be offensive
	  to those around you and are not appropriate for Space Apps
	  NYC.</p>

	<p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior,
	  the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate,
	  including warning the offender or expulsion from the
	  event. The participant will be responsible at all times for
	  any of their own costs incurred. If you are being harassed,
	  notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any
	  other concerns, please contact a member of Space Apps NYC
	  staff immediately.</p>

	<p>Space Apps NYC staff will be happy to help
	  participants contact venue security or local law
	  enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those
	  experiencing harassment to help them feel safe for the
	  duration of the event. We value your attendance.</p>

	<p>If the matter is especially urgent or a local
	  staff member is unavailable, please contact any of our
	  organizers &#8211; all reports are confidential.</p>
